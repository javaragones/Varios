# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

labwc-tweaks-gtk: This is a [WIP] configuration gui app for labwc without 
labwc-tweaks-gtk: real plan or Acceptance Criteria. It was merely written to
labwc-tweaks-gtk: help change themes for the purposes of testing labwc during 
labwc-tweaks-gtk: development. Don't expect too much
